# Portfolio â€“ Emna Debbech

Simple, responsive portfolio built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. Includes light/dark theme, smooth scrolling, and a basic contact form (no backend).

## Run locally

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
- Or serve with a lightweight server to avoid CORS issues for future assets:
```bash
# PowerShell (from project root)
python -m http.server 5500
# then visit http://localhost:5500
```
